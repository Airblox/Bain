Breaking down his movement, style and technique, it is obvious that “Chains\" is ex-military. It is likely he was special forces, and, based on overheard conversation, possibly even a former Navy SEAL.\n\n“Chains\" appears to have a daredevil personality, and a strong conviction that he cannot be hurt or killed.\n\nRecently, we know that “Chains\" was taking refuge in a Swedish safehouse. It was believed that he had been killed when Swedish police raided the safehouse, but \"Chains\" has since resurfaced in Washington.",
